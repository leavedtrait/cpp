# C++ starter template 

This is a C++20 template that demonstrates basic usage of enums, structs, and unique pointers. It includes a simple program setup with cmake as its build system.

## Requirements

- **CMake 3.8+** (for project configuration)
- **C++20-compatible compiler** (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, or MSVC)

### Installing Dependencies

Ensure you have a C++ compiler and CMake installed. For most systems:

- **Ubuntu (GCC)**:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential cmake
  
### How to build and run 
clone the repo and navigate to the projects directory
create a Build Directory
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
```
run CMake
```bash
cmake ..
```
build the project 
```bash
cmake --buiild .
```
run the project 
```bash 
./main
```
